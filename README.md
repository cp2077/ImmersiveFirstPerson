# LessUnimmersiveFirstPerson

This mod makes it easier to investigate V's body when looking down.  
*Works best with higher FOV.*

The camera is adaptive, so you don't have to worry about clipping. Camera will only apply when:
1. You're looking down
2. You're not holding any weapons
3. You're not in a vehicle
4. You're not in fixed camera cutscene.
5. You're not carrying a body

## Installation:

1. Make sure you've installed Cyber Engine Tweaks.
2. Drop the content of an archive into your cyberpunk directory (where the "bin" folder is).
