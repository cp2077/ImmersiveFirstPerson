# ImmersiveFirstPerson


## Features

1. Overall improved first-person view of V's body.
2. FreeLook: ability to rotate V's head (camera) without moving their body.  


This mod is adaptive, so you don't have to worry about clipping. The camera will only apply when:  
1. You're looking down
2. You're not holding any weapons
3. You're not in a vehicle
4. You're not in fixed camera cutscene.
5. You're not carrying a body
(let me know if there are other uncovered scenarios)


## Installation

1. Make sure you've installed Cyber Engine Tweaks.
2. Drop the content of an archive into your cyberpunk directory (where the "bin" folder is).


## Shortcuts
There are two types of hotkeys and they are assigned in two separate menus:
1. CET Overlay -> Bindings -> **Hotkeys** -> Toggle Enabled
2. Cet Overlay -> Bindings -> **Inputs** -> FreeLook


## Warning
Due to an internal game bug, some players may experience problems with their character getting stuck.  
In this case, reload the latest save file and uncheck option "Smooth Transition From FreeLook" or increase transition speed.
